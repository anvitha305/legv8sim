# legv8sim - A LEG-V8 Simulator and Additional Tools for Debugging/Editing 

Check the [legv8sim.tex](https://github.com/anvitha305/legv8sim/blob/master/legv8sim.tex) file as an overview of the system's goals.

## [Version 1.0 Sublime Highlighting](https://github.com/anvitha305/legv8sim/releases/tag/sublime)
Not really a version of the simulator, but rather Sublime editor's highlighting syntax defined so that I can use a particular parsing library that got put into a package. Future verison(s) will include support for more code editors to have LEG-V8 syntax highlighting.

## [Version 1.1 Vim Highlighting ðŸ¥°](https://github.com/anvitha305/legv8sim/releases/tag/vim)
Vim syntax highlighting, to make legv8sim editor-agnostic in terms of development so that you can edit the files on most of the common editors but you run it all on the same simulator. To view the source for this part of the project, go to the legv8-vim branch as they needed to be separated for reducing the bulk of the plugin.

## [Version 1.2 VSCode Highlighting](https://github.com/anvitha305/legv8sim/releases/tag/vs-code)
VSCode syntax highlighting brings another editor that is supported with the syntax highlighting grammar designed in this project. To view the source for this part of the project, go to the legv8-vscode branch.
