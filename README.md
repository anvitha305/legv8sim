# legv8sim - A LEG-V8 Simulator and Additional Tools for Debugging/Editing 

## Version 1.0 Sublime Highlighting
Not really a version of the simulator, but rather Sublime editor's highlighting syntax defined so that I can use a particular parsing library that got put into a package. Future verison(s) will include support for more code editors to have LEG-V8 syntax highlighting.
